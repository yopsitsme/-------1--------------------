# Hilbert's hotel

## Overview
This is the first of six projects in my full stack development journey. It focuses on creating a responsive website using only HTML and CSS. The site is designed to be fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to both desktop computer screens and iPhone Pro screens.

## Project Requirements
- Developed using Visual Studio Code
- Collaborative work (pair programming)
- Separation of HTML and CSS files
- Utilization of various HTML tags (e.g., div, p, span, h1, h2, header, footer, aside, navbar)
- CSS styling including different text sizes, fonts, colors, and borders
- HTML links (minimum 3 internal and 3 external)
- Implementation of HTML Images, HTML Media, and HTML Iframe
- Usage of HTML Lists, HTML Tables, and HTML Forms
- Responsive design for at least two screen sizes (bonus for three)
- Media Queries for different layouts on various screen sizes
- Implementation of CSS FlexBox and CSS Grid
- CSS effects and animations (recommended for final development stages)

## Features
- Fully responsive design
- Multiple HTML pages with consistent styling
- Interactive elements using CSS
- Embedded media content
- Form for user input
- Tabular data presentation

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- ## Responsive Breakpoints
- Desktop: 1024px and above
- Mobile: Below 1024px (optimized for iPhone Pro)

## Screenshots
To demonstrate the responsive design of this project, we've included screenshots at different screen sizes:

### Full Screen (Desktop)
